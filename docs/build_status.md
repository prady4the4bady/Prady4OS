# PRADYOS Build Status

Updated after every phase. Status legend:
🔴 NOT BUILT · 🟡 IN PROGRESS · 🟢 COMPLETE · ⚠️ BROKEN

**Current phase:** 4 — filesystem. Layer 2 (NEXUS kernel core) COMPLETE: boot →
long mode → ring-0 C kernel; own GDT/IDT; CPU exceptions w/ panic dumps; legacy
PIC + PIT @100Hz; buddy PMM (ADR-003) + SLAB heap (leak-free); higher-half
kernel @0xFFFFFFFF80000000 + kernel-owned VMM (ADR-007); preemptive round-robin
scheduler + asm context switch (~107 ns); NCS capability system (ADR-009, 11/11
tests); full NIA IPC fabric (sync + async ring + broadcast, ADR-010/011);
syscalls (NSI) + ring-3 user mode (ADR-012, SYSCALL/SYSRET, TSS, cap-gated).
**Phase 3 (Layer 3 drivers) COMPLETE:** ACPI parser + PCIe MMCONFIG enumeration
(ADR-013, 7 devices on q35); reusable modern-1.0 virtio transport + generic
block layer + interrupt-driven virtio-blk (ADR-014). **Phase 4 (Layer 4 FS)
underway:** VFS switch + read-only FAT32, capability-gated (ADR-015) — mounts a
FAT32 disk, lists directories, reads files by path **including nested
subdirectories** (slice 4b); verified on q35 with a second virtio-blk data disk.
virtio-blk is now multi-instance + per-device serialized. Next in Phase 4:
FAT32 writes (slice 4c), then SOVEREIGN FS (SFS). Build
is warning-clean and `-Werror` enforced (C + NASM). Deferred: 3-lane NAS, APIC,
W^X, SFS, ext4 (see DEFERRED section). Architecture confirmed against the user's
Layer 1–6 boards; realistic perf targets adopted (context switch ≤ 1.5 µs,
syscall ≤ 250 ns).
**Last updated:** 2026-06-18

## Phase 0 — Toolchain & Build System

Verified on WSL2 Ubuntu-22.04, 2026-06-17: clang 14.0.0, LLD 14.0.0,
NASM 2.15.05, QEMU 6.2.0, rustc/cargo 1.98.0-nightly (target
`x86_64-unknown-none`). `make toolchain-check` and `make smoke` both exit 0.

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Repo skeleton (mandated tree) | 🟢 COMPLETE | dirs + `.gitkeep`, ADRs, docs |
| Toolchain bootstrap script | 🟢 COMPLETE | `tools/build/setup_toolchain.sh` (WSL2), run OK |
| LLVM/Clang + lld + NASM + Rust nightly | 🟢 COMPLETE | installed + `make toolchain-check` links clean (exit 0) |
| x86_64 triple pinned | 🟢 COMPLETE | `x86_64-elf` confirmed on clang 14 (see ADR-001) |
| QEMU runner harness | 🟢 COMPLETE | `tools/qemu_runner/boot_test.sh` SKIPs cleanly (inert until P1) |
| CI Pipeline (QEMU boot) | 🟢 LIVE | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on push to `main`/`dev/**` + PRs: toolchain-check, `make image` (-Werror), `make smoke` (q35 kernel-sentinel gate), `make smoke-fs` (q35 FAT32 read end-to-end; installs dosfstools+mtools). `smoke` deliberately does not depend on the FAT image so the kernel gate never fails on a missing host FS tool. |

## Component Tracker (Phases 1–8)

| Component | Status | Phase | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------|
| PRADYOS-BOOT Stage 1 (MBR) | 🟢 COMPLETE | 1 | 512-byte MBR; INT 13h/AH=42h LBA read loads Stage 2, jumps to it. Kernel-ELF load deferred to Phase 2a (no kernel yet). |
| PRADYOS-BOOT Stage 2 | 🟢 COMPLETE | 1 | A20 (fast), INT 15h E820 walk, CPUID vendor + long-mode bit, flat GDT, 32-bit protected-mode switch, `PRADYOS BOOT OK` via COM1 + VGA. `make smoke` PASS. |
| UEFI Boot Path | 🔴 NOT BUILT | 1 | EDK2/OVMF-compatible; deferred (MBR path chosen first per user) |
| Hardware-info handoff struct | 🔴 NOT BUILT | 1 | E820 + CPUID gathered but not yet packaged for a kernel; blocked on Phase 2a |
| NEXUS Kernel Entry (asm) | 🟢 COMPLETE | 2a | 64-bit entry + C `kmain` in ring 0; kernel-owned flat GDT loaded (`arch/x86_64/cpu.asm`), CS reloaded via far return. |
| Boot→kernel handoff struct | 🟢 COMPLETE | 2a | `kernel/boot_info.h` ABI; Stage 2 fills it at phys 0x4000 (E820 map + vendor + LM), passes ptr in RDI; kernel re-prints the map. Closes Phase 1's last blocking item. |
| NEXUS Interrupt Handlers | 🟡 IN PROGRESS | 2a | IDT, 48 vectors (32 exceptions + 16 IRQ). Panic = fault + register dump + CR2 + backtrace + clean halt; `int3` recovers. Legacy 8259 PIC remapped + 8254 PIT @100Hz + keyboard IRQ; `sti` on; timer tick verified. APIC deferred to 2b (ADR-006). |
| NEXUS Context Switch (asm) | 🟢 COMPLETE | 2c | `arch/x86_64/context.asm`; measured ~275 cycles / ~107 ns @2.56 GHz (target ≤ 1.5 µs, board). TSC calibrated vs PIT. |
| Physical Frame Oracle / PMM | 🟢 COMPLETE | 2b | Buddy allocator (`kernel/pmm.{c,h}`, ADR-003) seeded from E820; orders 0..10, split/coalesce. Self-test: 0x6FE0 free frames, aligned alloc, balanced release. Manages [16 MiB, 1 GiB). |
| Virtual Memory Manager | 🟢 COMPLETE | 2b | Higher-half kernel @0xFFFFFFFF80000000 (ADR-007); bootloader maps high + low identity; kernel-owned `vmm_map`/`vmm_unmap` (`kernel/vmm.{c,h}`) allocate/reclaim tables from the PMM. Verified leak-free. NX/physmap/per-process CR3 deferred. |
| SLAB Allocator / kernel heap | 🟢 COMPLETE | 2b | `kernel/kheap.{c,h}` on the buddy PMM: size-class slab caches + whole-page large allocs; dedicated PCB/cap/IPC/page-table pools; debug poison + double-free + leak accounting. Stress test: no leak. Build is `-Werror` (C + NASM). |
| Process Control Blocks | 🟢 COMPLETE | 2c | Minimal TCB (`kernel/sched.h`): rsp, kstack, tid, state, quantum. Full PCB (caps, VAS, quotas) later. |
| NEXUS Adaptive Scheduler | 🟡 IN PROGRESS | 2c | Round-robin ready ring, PIT-preemptive, quantum 2 ticks (ADR-008). Two threads verified interleaving. 3-lane NAS + AI-hint lane deferred. |
| NCS Capability System | 🟢 COMPLETE | 2c | `kernel/cap.{c,h}` (ADR-009): opaque table-indexed handles, per-process tables on `tcb->caps`, O(1) generation-counter revoke, subset-only restrict/delegate, rights bitmap, guard-before-op. 11/11 tests pass. (MAC token = future external format only.) |
| NIA IPC (Sync + Async) | 🟢 COMPLETE | 2c | All 3 primitives: sync endpoint (block/wakeup), async lock-free SPSC ring, broadcast bus — all capability-gated + resource-bound (`kernel/ipc/`, ADR-010/011). Verified: sync exchange; ring 200 in-order; pub-sub filtered. |
| Sovereign Broadcast Bus | 🟢 COMPLETE | 2c | `kernel/ipc/bcast.{c,h}` (ADR-011): event-mask pub-sub, publish gated by CAP_BROADCAST, subscribe by CAP_IPC_RECV. Filtering verified. |
| Thread block/wakeup | 🟢 COMPLETE | 2c | `sched_block`/`sched_unblock`; `schedule()` skips non-runnable; idle always runnable |
| Syscall Table (200+ calls) | 🟡 IN PROGRESS | 2e | SYSCALL/SYSRET armed (EFER.SCE/STAR/LSTAR/SFMASK), dispatch table + register, capability-aware (`kernel/syscall/`, ADR-012). 4 calls (putc/getpid/yield/exit) exercised from ring 3; more arrive with userspace. |
| Ring-3 user mode (TSS + user segs) | 🟢 COMPLETE | 2e | `kernel/proc/tss.c`, user GDT segs, `sched_create_user`, IRETQ→ring3, cap-gated syscalls. Verified user thread runs + exits cleanly. |

## ⏸ DEFERRED — tracked, not dropped (interim implementation in place or later phase)

These are intentionally postponed. The current build is functionally complete
without them; each has a concrete "build before" trigger so it is not forgotten.

| Deferred item | Interim / status | Build before |
|---------------|------------------|--------------|
| **APIC** (Local + I/O APIC, APIC timer) | legacy 8259 PIC + PIT active | SMP; MSI device interrupts. Unblocked by the ACPI/MADT parser (Phase 3). |

| **Physical Frame Oracle** (variable-weight + predictive coalesce) | buddy PMM interim (ADR-003) | Sovereign Memory Pool / hugepages (Layer 6) |
| **Agent Virtual Address Space (AVAS)** (128 TB + RO state mirror) | — | AETHER bringup (Layer 6) |
| **Sovereign Memory Pool** (NUMA-pinned hugepages for weights) | — | AETHER/Ollama (Layer 6) |
| **W^X / NX per-section perms + guard pages** | EFER.NXE unused; user pages W+X | running untrusted user code |
| **UEFI / OVMF boot path** | legacy BIOS/MBR path complete | ARM64 / RISC-V variants (Layer 1) |
| **AVX-512 asm + IPC zero-copy (VMOVDQU)** | scalar paths | performance-hardening pass |
| **Larger/relocating kernel loader** | Stage 2 loads 256 KiB (8×64 sectors) to 0x10000 | kernel exceeds ~256 KiB, or moving the kernel off low memory |
| **virtio: MSI-X + multi-request** | INTx; one in-flight request **per device**, multi-disk via per-device serialization (ADR-015) | APIC live; concurrent in-flight I/O (request-tag table) |
